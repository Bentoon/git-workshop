## What Exactly is GitHub?

GitHub is a user interface, or UI, wrapper around Git, much like Spotify is a UI wrapper around audio, or iTunes around your music. In each of these, a core technology is wrapped in a graphical user interface.

For example, consider your computer. All major operating systems provide a user interface-driven method for creating a new folder. Additionally, they offer a command line interface that allows you to create a new folder with a simple command: `mkdir new-folder`.
